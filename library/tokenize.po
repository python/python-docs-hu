"The :mod:`tokenize` module provides a lexical scanner for Python source "
"code, implemented in Python.  The scanner in this module returns comments as"
" tokens as well, making it useful for implementing \"pretty-printers,\" "
"including colorizers for on-screen displays."

#: ../../library/tokenize.rst:19
msgid ""
"To simplify token stream handling, all :ref:`operators` and "
":ref:`delimiters` tokens are returned using the generic :data:`token.OP` "
"token type.  The exact type can be determined by checking the ``exact_type``"
" property on the :term:`named tuple` returned from "
":func:`tokenize.tokenize`."

"The :func:`.tokenize` generator requires one argument, *readline*, which "
"must be a callable object which provides the same interface as the "
":meth:`io.IOBase.readline` method of file objects.  Each call to the "
"function should return one line of input as bytes."

msgid ""
"The generator produces 5-tuples with these members: the token type; the "
"token string; a 2-tuple ``(srow, scol)`` of ints specifying the row and "
"column where the token begins in the source; a 2-tuple ``(erow, ecol)`` of "
"ints specifying the row and column where the token ends in the source; and "
"the line on which the token was found. The line passed (the last tuple item)"
" is the *logical* line; continuation lines are included.  The 5 tuple is "
"returned as a :term:`named tuple` with the field names: ``type string start "
"end line``."

"The returned :term:`named tuple` has an additional property named "
"``exact_type`` that contains the exact operator type for :data:`token.OP` "
